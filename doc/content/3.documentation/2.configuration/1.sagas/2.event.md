# Events

An event is something that happened which may result in a state change. An event can add or update instance data, as well as changing an instance's current
state. The `Event<T>` is generic, where `T` must be a valid message type.

## Declaring Events

In the example below, the _SubmitOrder_ message is declared as an event including how to correlate the event to an instance.

> Unless events implement `CorrelatedBy<Guid>`, they must be declared with a correlation expression.

```csharp
public record SubmitOrder(Guid OrderId);

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; } = null!;
}
```

## Configuring Events

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(
            () => SubmitOrder, 
            e => e.CorrelateById(cxt => cxt.Message.OrderId)
        );
    }
}
```

## Initiating Events

All State Machine Sagas come with the `Initial` state. The transition away from the Initial state is what creates an instance of the Saga.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    // public State Initial { get; private set; } 
    public State Submitted { get; private set; } = null!;

    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
              .Then(behaviorContext => 
              {
                var saga = behaviorContext.Saga;
                var message = behaviorContext.Message;

                saga.SomeProperty = message.SomeProperty;
              })
              .TransitionTo(Submitted)
              // Behavior Complete - Saga Persisted
        );
    }
}
```

## Advanced Options

Like most things in MassTransit, the everyday use case of MassTransit should not
need to use these options. But sometimes, you have to really dig in to make things
happen.

### Setting the Saga Factory

::alert{type="warning"}
The only time is when using `InsertOnInitial` and you have required properties
that must be present or the insert will fail. Typically with SQL and not null columns.
::

On events that are in the `Initial` state, a new instance of the saga will be
created. You can use the `SetSagaFactory` to control how the saga is instantiated.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(
            () => SubmitOrder, 
            e => 
            {
                e.CorrelateById(cxt => cxt.Message.OrderId)
                e.SetSagaFactory(cxt =>
                {
                    // complex constructor logic
                    return new OrderState 
                    {
                        CorrelationId = cxt.Message.Instance 
                    };
                });
            }
            
        );
    }
}
```
